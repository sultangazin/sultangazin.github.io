    title: "Learning Control From Expert Demonstrations"
    excerpt: '*(joint work with L. Fraile, L. Pannocchi, and P. Tabuada)*<br>
		We revisit the problem of learning a 
		stabilizing controller from a finite number of 
		demonstrations by an expert. The proposed algorithm
		requires only n+1 expert demonstrations, where n is the number of states of 
		the system being controlled. When we have more than n+1 
		demonstrations, at every time interval, we can choose the 
		best n+1 demonstrations to approximate the stabilizing controller
		in the best way. The 
		feasibility of the proposed algorithm is experimentally 
		demonstrated by applying it on a CrazyFlie 2.0 quadrotor.<br><br>

    title: "Privacy in Control Over the Cloud"
    excerpt: '*(joint work with P. Tabuada)*<br>
		Cloud computing platforms are being increasingly used 
		for closing feedback control loops, especially when 
		computationally expensive algorithms, such as 
		model-predictive control, are used to optimize
		performance. Outsourcing of control algorithms entails 
		an exchange of data between the control system and the 
		cloud, and, naturally, raises concerns about the privacy 
		of the control system’s data (e.g., state trajectory, 
		control objective). We propose several 
		transformation-based methods for enforcing data privacy. 
		We also quantify the amount of provided privacy and 
		discuss how much privacy is lost when the adversary has 
		access to side knowledge.<br><br>

    title: "AlphaPilot AI Drone Innovation Challenge"
    excerpt: '*(as a member of the team Formula Drone)*<br>
		Finished as the top qualifier among 424 teams, ahead of numerous
		teams and research groups. Worked on the design of the AI
		framework, written in C++ and powered by NVIDIA Jetson, that
		can pilot racing drones through aerial courses at high speed
		without GPS, data relay or human intervention. I designed 
		algorithms for optimal trajectory generation and obstacle avoidance.
		Was involved in training of the perception system, more specifically,
		during data collection and integration of the neural network with NVIDIA Jetson.<br>

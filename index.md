    title: "Learning From Expert Demonstrations"
    excerpt: 'We revisit the problem of learning a 
		stabilizing controller from a finite number of 
		demonstrations by an expert. The proposed algorithm
		requires only n+1 expert demonstrations, where n is the number of states of 
		the system being controlled. When we have more than n+1 
		demonstrations, at every time interval, we can choose the 
		best n+1 demonstrations to approximate the stabilizing controller
		in the best way. The 
		feasibility of the proposed algorithm is experimentally 
		demonstrated by applying it on a CrazyFlie 2.0 quadrotor.{: .text-justify}'
